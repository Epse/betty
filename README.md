# Betty

Betty is a Discord bot to unify all the needs of Belux vACC.

Betty is vaguely based on Elizabeth and replicates functionality of Babs,
two previous bots.
Elizabeth was built by Jeroen, Babs by Stef (not the author of this bot).

## Configuration

Most configuration is done via a config.json file.
You will find an example in this repo, as well as stricter typings in `config.ts`.

A very limited subset of sensitive configuration options are set via environment variable or `.env` file.
You will find these documented in `.env.example`.
